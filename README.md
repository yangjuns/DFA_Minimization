# DFA_Minimization

HOW TO USE:
  $> make
  $> ./main

Conclusions:
  In my implementations of Moore's and Brzozowski's algorithm, I found out that
  Moore's algorithm is always faster than Brzozowski's. I could not find some
  examples where Moore's algorithm is slower, no matter on specific examples or
  on average over random DFAs.

  It might be due to my bad implementation of Brzozowski's algorithm.
